THIS IS A FORK OF:


# üñê Ahoy!
![Logo](https://github.com/grindylow/ahoy/blob/main/doc/logo1_small.png?raw=true)



For details on the base project visit the Ahoy site.

This fork adds the following features:
### Added chart to Display128x64

### Added a History menu
This menu displays
- a bar-chart of the last 256 Total-Power values
- a bar chart of the last 256 Yield-Day values.
Note: The history of the values gets lost after rebbot!

### Changed WiFi reconnect behaviour
For me the original reconnect did not work. I always lost connection after some time.
Now it is more stable.

### Reduced frequency channels
Removed frequencies 2461, 2475MHz. Now the transfers are much more stable
