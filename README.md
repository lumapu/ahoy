# üñê Ahoy!
![Logo](https://github.com/lumapu/ahoy/blob/main/doc/logo1_small.png?raw=true)

This repository provides hardware and software solutions for communicating with Hoymiles inverters via radio. Our system allows you to easily obtain real-time values, such as power, current, and daily energy, as well as set parameters like the power limit of your inverter to achieve zero export. You can access these functionalities through our user-friendly web interface, MQTT, or JSON. Our solutions simplify the process of monitoring and fine-tuning your solar panel system to help you achieve your goals.
